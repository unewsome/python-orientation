# Music History

## Setup for Music History Exercise
If you haven't done this already:
```sh
mkdir -p ~/workspace/python/exercises/music-history && cd $_
```

> **Note:** The `.sql` extension is common practice for files storing SQL queries

Then download the [musichistory.db](./assets/musichistory.db) file into the directory you just created. That file **is** the database. It contains all of the tables and data.

## Instructions

Run the following command in the terminal to open the database file.

```sh
tableplus musichistory.db
```

For each of the following exercises, provide the appropriate query. Yes, even the ones that are expressed in the form of questions. Everything from class and the [Sqlite](http://www.sqlite.org/) documentation for SQL [keywords](https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html) and [functions](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html) is fair game.

1. Query all of the entries in the `Genre` table
1. Using the `INSERT` statement, add one of your favorite artists to the `Artist` table.
1. Using the `INSERT` statement, add one, or more, albums by your artist to the `Album` table.
1. Using the `INSERT` statement, add some songs that are on that album to the `Song` table.
1. Write a `SELECT` query that provides the song titles, album title, and artist name for all of the data you just entered in. Use the [`LEFT JOIN`](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-using-joins.htm) keyword sequence to connect the tables, and the `WHERE` keyword to filter the results to the album and artist you added.
    > **Reminder:** Direction of join matters. Try the following statements and see the difference in results.

    ```
    SELECT a.Title, s.Title FROM Album a LEFT JOIN Song s ON s.AlbumId = a.AlbumId;
    SELECT a.Title, s.Title FROM Song s LEFT JOIN Album a ON s.AlbumId = a.AlbumId;
    ```
1. Write a `SELECT` statement to display how many songs exist for each album. You'll need to use the `COUNT()` function and the `GROUP BY` keyword sequence.
1. Write a `SELECT` statement to display how many songs exist for each artist. You'll need to use the `COUNT()` function and the `GROUP BY` keyword sequence.
1. Write a `SELECT` statement to display how many songs exist for each genre. You'll need to use the `COUNT()` function and the `GROUP BY` keyword sequence.
1. Using `MAX()` function, write a select statement to find the album with the longest duration. The result should display the album title and the duration.
1. Using `MAX()` function, write a select statement to find the song with the longest duration. The result should display the song title and the duration.
1. Modify the previous query to also display the title of the album.
